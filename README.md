A custom crater dataset class was created to fit with the pytorch training process shown at https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references/detection. Some of these files have been used within the git repository to aid in training and processing. 
 
The software has been verified on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) and Unix distributions, with windows compatibility having been demonstrated only in early versions. Image data is not included in this repository, and must be gathered separately.
